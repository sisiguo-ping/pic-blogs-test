<html> <head></head> <body> <p>At Ping Identity, we are always watching for new research in the area of identity standards. You may have seen one such paper recently: the blog article <a href="https://www.cyberark.com/threat-research-blog/golden-saml-newly-discovered-attack-technique-forges-authentication-cloud-apps/" target="_blank">Golden SAML: Newly Discovered Attack Technique Forges Authentication to Cloud Apps</a>. While the title of the blog post may be alarming at first glance, further examination points out the following:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin-left: 30px;">"This attack doesn't rely on a vulnerability in SAML 2.0. It's not a vulnerability in AWS/ADFS, nor in any other service or identity provider... Golden SAML is rather similar. It's not a vulnerability per se, but it gives attackers the ability to gain unauthorized access to any service in a federation (assuming it uses SAML, of course) with any privileges and to stay persistent in this environment in a stealthy manner."</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our security and identity teams have analyzed the claims in the blog post, and we believe that there are two primary claims: 1) that an attacker gaining access to the private signing key for a SAML Identity Provider may use that key to impersonate users, and 2) that this fact is a new disclosure.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </body> </html>

<html> <head></head> <body> <p>At Ping Identity, we are always watching for new research in the area of identity standards. You may have seen one such paper recently: the blog article <a href="https://www.cyberark.com/threat-research-blog/golden-saml-newly-discovered-attack-technique-forges-authentication-cloud-apps/" target="_blank">Golden SAML: Newly Discovered Attack Technique Forges Authentication to Cloud Apps</a>. While the title of the blog post may be alarming at first glance, further examination points out the following:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin-left: 30px;">"This attack doesn't rely on a vulnerability in SAML 2.0. It's not a vulnerability in AWS/ADFS, nor in any other service or identity provider... Golden SAML is rather similar. It's not a vulnerability per se, but it gives attackers the ability to gain unauthorized access to any service in a federation (assuming it uses SAML, of course) with any privileges and to stay persistent in this environment in a stealthy manner."</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our security and identity teams have analyzed the claims in the blog post, and we believe that there are two primary claims: 1) that an attacker gaining access to the private signing key for a SAML Identity Provider may use that key to impersonate users, and 2) that this fact is a new disclosure.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </body> </html>
